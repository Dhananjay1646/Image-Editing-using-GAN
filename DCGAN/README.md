# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

Tensorflow implementation of DCGAN following this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). Referenced torch code can be found [here](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.3+
* Tensorflow 
* pillow (PIL)
* matplotlib 
* (Optional) [CelebA Face Database](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html): Large Scale Face database used for training the model 

## Results 
Sampling through epochs during training.
